## Definition
A Ecosystem is a set of at least two (autonomous) [parties](party) (the members of the ecosystem) whose individual work complements that of other members, and is of benefit to the set as a whole.

An ecosystem is distinct from a [community](community) in the sense that it is not (necessarily) an [organization](organization) that (actively) facilitates the cooperation between its members. A [community](community) is considered a specialization of the more generic 'ecosystem' concept.

## Purpose
The purpose of forming, or being part of an ecosystem, is that a [party](party) can focus on a specific topic area, rely on others to provide for its needs, and being appreciated for the value of its own work as it provides for the needs of others.

## Criterion
A Ecosystem is a set of at least two (autonomous) [parties](party) whose individual work complements that of others, and is of benefit to the set as a whole.
