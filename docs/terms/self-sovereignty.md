## Definition
*Self-Sovereignty* is the characteristic of every [party](party) that it is autonomous in managing and operating its [own](owner) [knowledge](knowledge), particularly in making decisions and deciding how to decide.

## Background
The background of our understanding of 'self-sovereignty' can be found in articles 8-10 of the [*European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)*](https://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=basictexts/convention), that state the rights of individuals regarding their privacy, and their freedoms to collect, process, store, and express information in a self-sovereign fashion, i.e. in a way that they can decide for themselves. This is without prejudice to Member States' laws that exist to protect their national security, public safety, the economic well-being of the country, health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, or to prevent disorder or crime.

The eSSIF-Lab vision extends these rights and freedoms - within the limits of the law - to public and private organizations. Thus, we say that individuals as well as public and private organizations (that we collectively refer to as '[parties](party)') are [self-sovereign](self-sovereignty), or autonomous.

## Implications
The characteristic of [self-sovereignty](self-sovereignty), that we attribute to every single [party](party), has profound consequences. Here are a few:

Every [party](party) decides autonomously on the *meaning/definition of [terms](terminology) that it uses in an attempt to convey such meaning to other parties. The fact that such other parties also do this is a major cause of misunderstandings, as the same words may have different meanings for different parties. The eSSIF-Lab [Terminology pattern](pattern-terminology) provides a mental model and a mechanism that is aimed to detect such misunderstandings and resolve them.

Since every [party](party) is autonomous in its decision making, any argument that it uses for reaching a conlusion (decision) is subjective (=specific for that party). This implies that the kinds of data which a party needs in order to decide whether or not to commit to a [transaction](transaction) are subjective, as well as the data it needs in order to decide whether or not such data is [valid](validation) to be used in such an argument.

## Purpose
The purpose of having the term [Self-Sovereignty](self-sovereignty) is to emphasize that every [party](party) is autonomous/self-sovereign and make people aware of the implications that this has.
