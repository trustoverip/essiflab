## Definition
**Risk management** is a process that is run by (or on behalf of) a specific [party](party) for the purpose of managing the [risks](risk) that it [owns](owner). We distinguish between various kinds of risk-management:
- **centralized risk-management**, which is a kind of risk management that assumes that the [party](party) that runs it has the power or right to give orders, make decisions that other parties must follow, and enforce obedience, which can be applied to mitigate its risks. This kind of risk-management ignores the natural autonomy of other [parties](party).
- **decentralized or networked risk-management**, which is a kind of risk management that assumes that the [party](party) that runs it acknowledges the autonomy of other [parties](party) to make their own (risk-related) decisions, and therefore starts and maintains relations with such parties that help them both to manage their individual, subjective risks.

## Purpose
The purpose of a **Centralized Risk Management Process** is to manage the [risks](risk) within its scope., thereby only taking the objectives, risks and interests of other [parties](party) into account if that helps to manage its own risks (or has other benefits).

The purpose of a **Decentralized Risk Management Process** is to manage [risks](risk) within its scope as well as to contribute to the management of the risks of other [parties](party).

## Criterion
An Risk Management (process) is a set of related [Activities](action-type) that [parties](party) can run for the purpose of ensuring that the set of [objectives](objective) they [own](owner) come with [risks](risk) that it finds acceptable. In other ords: the [party](party) ensures that the work that must be done in order to realize its [objectives](objective) is such that the uncertainty that these objectives are not realized, is acceptable.

A Centralized Risk management (process) is a Risk Management process that only takes the interests parties other than the one that runs the process into account if that is a (net) benefit to that party.

A Decentralized Risk management (process) is a Risk Management process that aims to manage the risks of the [party](party) that runs it, as well as contribute to the management of risks of parties with which the party has a relationship.
