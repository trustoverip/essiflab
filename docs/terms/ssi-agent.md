## Definition
An **SSI-agent** is a [digital agent](digital-agent) that provides one or more of the SSI functionalities (i.e. [issuer](issuer), [holder](holder), [verifier](verifier), [wallet](wallet)) to its [principal](principal).

## Purpose
<!--State the purpose(s) for which it is necessary (or at least: desirable) to define <New Term>.-->
The ability to distinguish between (non)SSI agents allows us to exclusively talk about agents that provide some or all of the SSI functionalities (i.e. [issuer](issuer), [holder](holder), [verifier](verifier), [wallet](wallet)).

See also: [digital agent](digital-agent), and [agent](agent).
