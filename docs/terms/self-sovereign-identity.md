## Definition
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a term that has many different interpretations, and that we use to refer to [concepts/ideas](concept), architectures, processes and technologies that aim to support (autonomous) [parties](party) as they negotiate and execute electronic [transactions](transaction) with one another.

The dialogue about what Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) really is, that was started in the blog "[The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html)" by Christopher Allen in 2016, has not resulted in a consensus today. While some see the ten principles of SSI that Allen proposed as the definition of SSI, he formulated them as "a departure point to provoke a discussion about what's truly important". And it is obvious that what is important differs per [party](party).

The perspective that the eSSIF-Lab framework takes is that of supporting (autonomous) [parties](party) as they negotiate and execute electronic [(business) transactions](transaction) with one another. So anything that helps - e.g. concepts/ideas, architectures, processes and technologies, will be covered by that term.

## Purpose
The purpose of having the term [Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)](self-sovereign-identity) is that it is an easy way to indicate what is within and what is outside the scope of the eSSIF-Lab framework. Anything in scope is covered by this term, and everything else is not.
