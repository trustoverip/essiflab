## Definition
A **Scope of Control (of a Party)** is the extent of the area or subject matter (as in [OED](https://www.lexico.com/definition/scope) that the [party](party) controls. One might say that the party is 'sovereign' or 'autonomous' within its scope of control.

A party that can also control (the behaviour of [agents](agent) of) other parties can be referred to as a [jurisdiction](jurisdiction) (see also the [jurisdiction pattern](pattern-jurisdiction)).

## Purpose
Knowing the **Scope of Control (of a Party)** helps other parties as well as the party itself to determine what (not) to expect of that party.

## Criteria
:::info Help wanted
Suggestions for criteria are welcomed.
:::

## Examples
- The scope of control of a nation's government is typically limited by the physical area of the nation and the behaviors that [actors](actor) and [parties](party) may exhibit there.
- The scope of control of an individual is limited by what it can do by him/herself, and the rights and duties that it has been assigned in or by some [jurisdiction](jurisdiction).
