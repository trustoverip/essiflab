## Definition
The **SSI Infrastructure** consists of the technological components that are (envisaged to be) deployed all over the world for the purpose of providing, requesting and obtaining [qualified data](qualified-data) for the purpose of negotiating and/or executing electronic [transactions](transaction).

Like any other (hard) [Infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure), such components are (to be) designed to be interoperable, both
- 'horizontally', i.e. with other infrastructural components, and
- 'vertically', i.e. that it is very easy for other software applications to use them.

It is foreseen that SSI components in this infrastructure are designed and created in a generic way, and hence need to be customizable, so that an individual compnent can work according to the (needs and preferences|policy)-of-the [parties](party) for which it is an [agent](agent).

This implies that the SSI Infrastructure (a 'hard' infratstructure) needs to be complemented with a complementary 'soft infrastructure', e.g. as can be provided with [assurance communities](ssi-assurance-community).

## Purpose
The **SSI Infrastructure** supports the sustainable functionality of [parties](party) by providing IT services and facilities necessary for (electronic) [transactions](transaction) to be negotiated and executed.
