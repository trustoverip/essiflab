## Definition
**Data** something (tangible) that can be used to communicate a meaning (which is intangible/information). Examples include words, bit(string)s, pictures, sounds, smells, tastes, etc. We use the term [digital data](digital-data) to refer to data that consists of bits.

## Purpose
The purpose of **Data** is that it provides a means to communicate meaning. Also, it allows for (tangible) ways of processing, e.g. reasoning in more or less formal ways (as opposed to associating).

## Criteria
**Data** is something (tangible) that can be used to communicate a meaning (which is intangible/information).

## Related concepts
- The concept we call Data is closely relatd to the word [Sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(semiotics)) in [semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics).
- [Semantics](semantics) is the mapping between (tangible) data and (intangible) meaning/information (see also [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics) for the various flavours). Semantics are scoped, and every [party](party) has - and maintains - its own (subjective) semantics, i.e. the mapping between its [knowledge](knowledge) and the data he uses to express that knowledge, as well as the mapping between data that the party receives and the [concepts](concept) in its knowledge that are associated with that.
