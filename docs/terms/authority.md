## Definition
An **Authority** is a [party](party) of which certain decisions, ideas, rules etc. are followed by other [parties](party). We distinguish between two kinds of authority:
- centralized authority, also known as the power or right to give orders, make decisions that other parties must follow, and enforce obedience. This kind of authority ignores the natural autonomy of other [parties](party).
- decentralized authority, also known as the power or right that is freely endowed by other [parties](party) to the authority, to make decisions, phrase ideas, set rules etc, which these parties will adopt and follow because they think it is in their own interest to do so.

## Purpose
The purpose of a **Centralized Authority** is to further its own [objectives](objective) by using (to the level of exploiting) other [parties](party), thereby possibly disregarding the objectives and interests of these other parties if the authority deems that necessary.

The purpose of a **Decentralized Authority** is to further the [objectives](objective) of the [parties](party) that have endowed it with its powers or rights. It is an objective of such an authority to support these parties in their pursuit of their own, individual objectives.

## Criterion
An Authority is a [party](party), part of whose [knowledge](knowledge) (e.g. decisions, ideas, logic, rules, guidance, etc.) is being followed or used by other [parties](party).

A Centralized Authority is an [authority](authority) that imposes this part of its [knowledge](knowledge) on other [parties](party).

A Decentralized Authority is an [authority](authority) that makes its [knowledge](knowledge) available and leaves it entirely up to other [parties](party) to decide whether or not to follow or use it.
