## Definition
**Objectives** drive [parties](party) as they make their goals explicit, the primary one of which is also referred to as the **mission** of that [party](party). A [party's](party) objectives are part of its [knowledge](knowledge). When made available to [agents](agent) of that [party](party), these agents can do the work that is needed to reach these goals (realize the [party's](party) objectives).

## Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non)objectives is relevant as objectives are the drivers behind the reasoning and decisions that [parties](party) make, the policies and working instructions that they specify so that its [agents](agent) know what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. Moreover, objectives are 1-1 associated with risks (i.e. the level of uncertainty that the [party](party) experiences regarding whether a specific objective is going to be appropriately realized). Finally, objectives must be known in order to obtain (personal) data according to the [GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj).

## Criterion
A text representing something toward which a [party](party) directs its efforts: an aim, goal, or end of action.

## Examples
- generically: anything that, according to a [party](party) c.q. its way of thinking, is important to be realized, qualifies as an Objective (and identifies its owner as that [party](party)).
- most people have the objective 'stay alive'.
- the equivalent in organizations is 'continuation of its existence' (many operate 'business-continuity processes' to realize this, and to identify and mitigate any associated risks).
