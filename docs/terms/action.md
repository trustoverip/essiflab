## Definition
An **Action** is something that is actually done/executed by a [actor](actor) in some context (i.e. in a specific place, at a specific time). During the time interval in which the action is executed, the actor may still execute other actions in other execution-contexts (multi-tasking). An action is executed on behalf of a specific [party](party), which means that the primary guidance for executing the action, e.g. how to execute it, boundary conditions within which the execution must take place, etc., comes from a [policy](policy) that this [party](party) has established for actions of that kind. The actor is assumed to have appropriate access to that policy.

The [Parties, Actors and Actions pattern](pattern-party-actor-action) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

## Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non)actions allows one to determine which (kinds of) [actors](actor) are capable of executing actions (e.g. by establishing that they have the competences required by the [party](party)), and as a consequence may be permitted and/or required to execute them. Also, this ability enables [parties](party) to determine the execution-policy, i.e. the set of rules, working-instructions, preferences and other guidance that actors should obey or comply with when exeucting an action on its behalf.

## Criterion
An **Action** is something that is done by an actor, can be considered a single operation, and is performed in a specific context, for or on behalf of a specific [party](party), i.e. in accordance with the policy rules that this [party](party) has established for such actions.

## Examples
- filling in a form and submitting it.
- cleaning a car.
