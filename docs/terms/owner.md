## Definition
<!--REQUIRED--in 1-3 sentences that describe the concept to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.-->
An **Owner** is a role that a [party](party) performs when it is exercizing its legal, rightful or natural title to control some [entity](entity).

We interpret 'legal' and 'rightful' as terms that apply to _any_ [jurisdiction](jurisdiction) (that is: not just [legal/national jurisdictions](legal-jurisdiction), but also those of other [organizations](organization) ([parties](party)).

We take 'natural' as a title that is provided by nature, as in 'the owner of an [assertion](assertion)'.

For futher details, see [ownership](ownership).

## Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non)owners of an [entity](entity) enables one to identify the [party](party) and the duties (and rights) it has regarding the [owned](owned). One may want to do so either to establish whether or not the [owned](owned) [entity](entity), e.g. if it is an [actor](actor), can be trusted to behave according to its [owner's](owner) [policies](policy). Or, one may want to do this in order to settle a dispute it has.

## Criteria
A [party](party) is said to be the **owner** of some [(legal) entity](legal-entity) in some [jurisdiction](jurisdiction) if and only if an [ownership relation](ownership) exists with that [jurisdiction](jurisdiction).
