## Definition
A **Data Collector Policy** is a [digital policy](digital-policy) that enables an operational [Data Collector component](data-collector) to function according to the rules of its [Policy Governor](policy-governor).

Such a policy includes e.g. the kinds of data (and meta-data) required to make these kinds of decisions, criteria to distinguish between [data that is valid](validated-data) and data that is not, any data conversions that may be needed, etc.

## Purpose
The purpose of a **Data Collector Policy** is to enable the creation of (technical) components that implement the generic [data collector](data-collector) functionality that will subsequently use such policies to guide their behaviour.

## Criteria
A **Data Collector Policy** is a [digital policy](digital-policy) that enables an operational [Data Collector component](data-collector) to function according to the rules, working-instructions and other guidance of its [Policy Governor](policy-governor).
