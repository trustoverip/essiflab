## Definition
Inspired by [Pfitzmann and Hansen (2010)](https://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf), we define **Partial Partial identity (of an [entity](entity))** as the [knowledge](knowledge) that a specific [party](party) has about that [entity](entity) (= the 'subject').

Note that because a partial identity is knowledge of that party, it follows automatically that this party is also the [owner](owner) of that partial identity.

A [party](party) that has [knowledge](knowledge) about itself will thus have a [partial identity](partial-identity) that it is both the subject and the [owner](owner) of. This is called the [Self-Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept) or [Self-concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept) of that party.





A party does not control the partial identities for which it is the subject, except the one that it owns itself (its [self-concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept)). People that expect they can [own](ownership) all partial identities of which they are the subject, are in for disappointment, as all (except one) such partial identities are outside their [scope of control](scope-of-control).

Parties that issue credentials about an entity thus issue claims that are part of the [partial identity](partial-identity) that this party has about the entity. If that party is coherent and consistent in its knowledge, and does not lie, then we may assume that the set of claims in the credential of an issuer is also coherent and consistent, and that this party believes that the knowledge represented by such claims is true.

For further details, see [identity](identity), [identifier](identifier) and the [identity pattern](pattern-identity)
