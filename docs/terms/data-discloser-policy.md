## Definition
A **Data Discloser Policy** is a [digital policy](digital-policy) that enables an operational [Data Discloser component](data-discloser) to function according to the rules of its [Policy Governor](policy-governor).

## Purpose
The purpose of a **Data Discloser Policy** is to enable the creation of (technical) components that implement the generic [data discloser](data-discloser) functionality that will subsequently use such policies to guide their behaviour.

## Criteria
A **Data Discloser Policy** is a [digital policy](digital-policy) that enables an operational [Data Discloser component](data-discloser) to function according to the rules, working-instructions and other guidance of its [Policy Governor](policy-governor).
