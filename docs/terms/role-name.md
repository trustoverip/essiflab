## Definition
A **Role name** is a name by which a [role](role) can be referred to, and which [identifies](identifier) that [role](role) in contexts in which it is used. Accordingly, using it without properly referencing the context may cause misunderstandings, as role names refer to different [roles](role) in different contexts.

A role name is also used to refer to an (arbitrary) [entity](entity) that performs the [role](role) that the role name actually refers to. For example if 'issuer' is a role-name for [entities](entity). For example, the role name '[Agent](agent)' is used to generically refer to an (arbitrary) [actor](actor) that is executing some [action](action) on behalf of a [party](party).
