## Definition
The [owner](owner) of a [risk](risk) that is associated with an [objective](objective) must be the [party](party) that [owns](owner) that [objective](objective), and vice versa, because [ownership](ownership) implies the [authority](authority) to realize the [objective](objective), which in turn implies the authority to manage the associated risks. Of course, as [owners](owner) are [parties](party), a risk owner may mandate actors to execute the actions that are necessary to manage a risk, but that does not relieve the party from its ownership (and facing possibly associated consequences). In fact, the objective of mandating risk management activities may come with risks which are often overlooked.

## Purpose
Knowing who [owns](owner) a [risk](risk) is knowing who is accountable when something goes wrong.
