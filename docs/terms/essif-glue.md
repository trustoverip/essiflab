## Definition
The **eSSIF-Glue** is an interface layer that consists of a documented set of APIs between the [Transaction Data Collector](transaction-data-collector) and [Transaction Data Discloser](transaction-data-discloser) on the one hand, and the Wallet, Holder, Issuer and Verifier (WHIV) components on the other hand.

 Ultimately, we would like to see these APIs standardized. Having such APIs allows different [parties](party) to create their own version of the WHIV components, supporting the SSI technologies as they see fit, and shrinking or expanding functionalities as they feel appropriate. [parties](party) can then select such WHIV components as they see fit.

## Purpose
The purpose of the essif-Glue APIs is to make calling the WHIV functions as simple as possible, given the functions of the [Transaction Data Collector](transaction-data-collector) and [Transaction Data Discloser](transaction-data-discloser)

## Criterion
The set of API's described at https://gitlab.grnet.gr/essif-lab/tno-ssi-service/developer-docs.
