## Definition
An **Agent** is an [actor](actor) that is executing an action [action](action) on behalf of some [party](party) (which we call the [principal](principal) of that agent). During the time interval in which the action is executed, the actor may execute other actions in other execution-contexts, on behalf of the same or another [party](party). However, for the execution of a single [action](action), the actor is an agent for precisely one principal. It is assumed that the principal provides its agents with the [policies](policy) that provide the agents with the rules, working-instructions, preferences and other guidance that they need to comply with when exeucting the action.

The [Parties, Actors and Actions pattern](pattern-party-actor-action) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

## Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non)agents is relevant in many situations, including:
- electronic communication: the agent

## Criterion
**Agent** is a [role name](role-name) that generically refers to an [actor](actor) that is executing some [action](action) on behalf of a [party](party).

## Examples

- A person that is 'doing its own things' acts as an Agent for himself.
- A person that does things for his employer acts as an Agent for that employer.
- An ambassador, when (s)he is 'in function', acts as an Agent for the country for which (s)he is ambassador.
- A person that fills in the tax return form for someone else acts as an Agent for this someone else.
- A company that makes cars may use robots that weld parts of a car together; these robots acts as Agents for that company.
- A (running) webserver that accepts product orders for a retailer acts as a (digital) Agent for that retailer.
- A wallet app that runs on a phone and that is exclusively used by a single person acts as a (digital) Agent for that person.
