:::info Editor's note
This is work in progress
:::

The idea here is to define 'identifier' as the combination of a
- symbol (usually a text, but it could be a picture or something else)
- type/class (that classifies the kind of symbol, not the kind of entity that is identified)
- scope/context/namespace (within which the symbol can be used to identify an entity)
- governing Party (i.e. that [owns](ownership) the identifier)

Earliest ideas for this came out of "[Putting Identifiers in the Context of eHealth](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-387-79026-8_27.pdf)"
