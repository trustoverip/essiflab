:::info Editor's note
This is work in progress
:::

The idea here is to describe how terms are scoped ('namespaces' is the term used by SW-engineers), how parties govern such scopes/namespaces, and that if you use criteria to define/specify terms, people can test if they have the same understanding of a term by making sure that everyone reaches the same conclusions as they evaluate such criteria in various relevant use-cases.
