## Definition
A **Transaction Data Discloser Policy** is a [digital policy](digital-policy) that enables an operational [Transaction Data Discloser component](transaction-data-discloser) to function according to the rules of its [Policy Governor](policy-governor).

## Purpose
The purpose of a **Transaction Data Discloser Policy** is to enable the creation of (technical) components that implement the generic [Transaction Data Discloser](transaction-data-discloser) functionality that will subsequently use such policies to guide their behaviour.

## Criteria
A **Transaction Data Discloser Policy** is a [digital policy](digital-policy) that enables an operational [Transaction Data Discloser component](transaction-data-discloser) to function according to the rules, working-instructions, preferences and other guidance of its [Policy Governor](policy-governor).
