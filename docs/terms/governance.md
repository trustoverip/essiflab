## Definition
**Governance** is the act (executed by, or behalf of some [party](party)) or process (of some [party](party)) of governing or overseeing the control and direction of something ([Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/governance)). The governance of a [party](party) is embodied by the set of processes by which it decides how to make (other) decisions, how [actors](actor) that it [employs](employee) are to behave and operate, and ensure this guidance ends up in documents (which we will call [policies](policy)).

As [parties](party) interact with one another, i.e. conduct [business transactions](transaction), they need to decide whether or not to commit to a transaction proposal. Deciding about how to make such a decision is one of the subjects of the governance process of that [party](party): it is establishing the kind of argument that may be used to make this decision.

Within eSSIF-Lab, governance is pretty much limited to the governance of various [policies](policy).

The [Parties, Actors and Actions pattern](pattern-party-actor-action) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

## Purpose
The purpose for a [party](party) of having a **governance** process is that it enables him to reflect on the ways that it makes decisions. A typical topic for governance is the maintenance of the set of rules, working-instructions, preferences and other guidance that [actors](actor) are supposed, or required to use when executing specific [actions](action) on behalf of that [party](party).

For [digital-actors](digital-actor) such guidance consists of [digital policies](digital-policy). A [party](party) whose governance process maintains a [policy](policy) will be called the [governor](policy-governor) of that policy.
