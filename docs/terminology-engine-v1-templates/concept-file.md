<!--A concept tries to capture the idea behind a classification of entities, allowing us to reason about everything in the class as if it were one thing. This file specifies the idea(s) that, within the scope of `<existing-scopeID>` will be referred to using `<New Term>`.
Please fill in the placeholders in this file as follows:
- `<existing-scopeID>`: machine readable text that identifies the scope in which this term is defined;
- `<Existing Scope>`: human readable text that identifies the scope in which this term is defined;
- `<new-termID>`: machine readable text that identifies this term within `<existing-scopeID>`;
- `<New Term>`: human readable text that identifies this term within `<Existing Scope>`;
-->

### Short Description
<!--REQUIRED--in 1-3 sentences that describe the concept to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.-->

### Purpose
<!--Describe why the concept is needed. What purposes does it serve? What can you do with it that you cannot do (as well) without it? What objectives does it help realize? Why is this concept relevant within its scope of definition?-->

### Criteria
<!--REQUIRED--How is this concept different from related ideas? What are essential characteristics that must be true? This is where you specify the [intensional definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions) of the concept, i.e. the necessary and sufficient conditions for when the term should be used. This makes that the concept becomes crystal clear. In the case of nouns, this is equivalent to specifying the properties that an object needs to have in order to be counted as a referent of the term.-->

### Examples
<!--Provide a few sentences in which you give examples that obviously qualify as instances of `<New Term>`, and that do NOT obviously qualify. Also, provide examples that are not (so) obvious, but help users to better understand its intension.-->

### Related Concepts
<!--Link to any concepts that are similar but distinct, with a note about the relationship.-->

### Background
<!--Mention and link to the patterns in which this concept plays a (significant) role (possibly explaining the reason/purpose if appropriate), e.g.: The %%terminology pattern|pattern-terminology%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.-->

### Domains
<!--In which general knowledge ecosystems or mental model families does this concept play a role?-->

### Tags
<!--Add hash tags here that allow us to group concepts in useful ways.-->

### Use-cases
<!--This (optional) section specifies an (optional) introductory paragraph, and a level-3 (i.e. `###`) subsection for every use case it describes. Every such use-case SHOULD
- describe the situation/context of the use-case;
- show how to apply `<New Term>` to/in that situation;
- shows the relevance of having `<New Term>` for the use-case as opposed to not having it.-->

### Notes
<!--This (optional) section is the place to put anything for which there is no other good place to put it.-->
