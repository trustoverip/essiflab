<!--A glossary is an alphabetically sorted list of terms with (short) explanations, usually aimed to help people understand texts around a certain (set of) topic(s) in some context(s).
Please fill in the placeholders in this file as follows:
- `<existing-scopeID>`: identifier of the scope in which the term is defined;
- `<Existing Scope>`: human readable text that identifies the scope in which this item is defined;
- `<new-glossaryID>`: identifier by which the glossary can be identified within <existing-scopeID>;
-->

### Purpose
<!--State the purpose(s) that this glossary aims to fulfill, in such a way that readers can easily determine whether or not it is useful for them to use it.-->

### Sources
<!--This section specifies the sources from which the glossary entries (and their descriptions) are to be collected. All terms from all sources are included in the glossary. If that is too much, then you should revert to stating individual terms, patterns or concepts (see below).-->

### Terms
<!--Specify the term-files that are to be included in this glossary. If a term is defined in a scope as well as in a term-file, then both are included in the glossary (where the scope identifier is used to distinguish between them). -->

### Concepts
<!--Specify the concept-files that are to serve as a source for this glossary. If a term is defined in a scope, or as a term, or in a pattern as well as in a concept-file, the latter takes precedence.-->

### Patterns
<!--Specify the pattern-files that are to serve as a source for this glossary. If a term is defined in a scope or as a term as well as in a pattern-file, then both are included in the glossary (where the scope identifier is used to distinguish between them).-->

### Glossaries
<!--Specify the glossary-files all terms of which are to be included in this glossary.-->
