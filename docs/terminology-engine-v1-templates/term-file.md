<!--A Term is a word or phrase that is used in at least one scope (context and/or for specific purposes) to refer to some concept.
Please fill in the placeholders in this file as follows:
- `<existing-scopeID>`: machine readable text that identifies the scope in which this term is defined;
- `<Existing Scope>`: human readable text that identifies the scope in which this term is defined;
- `<new-termID>`: machine readable text that identifies this term within <existing-scopeID>;
- `<New Term>`: human readable text that identifies this term within <Existing Scope>;
- `<ExistingConceptScopeID>`: identifier of the scope in which the concept, to which the new term will refer, is known;
- `<ExistingtermID>`: machine readable identifier that identifies a concept within <ExistingConceptScopeID>
-->

### Purpose
<!--State the purpose(s) for which it is necessary (or at least: desirable) to define <New Term>.-->

### Notes
<!--Usually, the meaning of a term will not be _exactly_ the same as that of the concept to which it refers. Often, there are slight differences in meaning, or the term may emphasize specific characteristics of the concept, so as to accommodate specific needs of the scope in which it is defined. Please describe such deviations/emphasized characteristics in this section, and which needs that helps accommodate.-->
