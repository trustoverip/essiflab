## Purpose
The purpose of the eSSIF-Lab is to specify, develop and validate technological and non-technological (e.g. governance) means that support people, businesses and governments to think about, design, adapt, and operate their (information) processes such that they can negotiate and conduct %%business transactions|transaction%% with one another using the electronic support provided by the various SSI technologies.

## Objectives
For this purpose, eSSIF-Lab has set the following %%objectives|objective%% to realize:

### Empower European and other citizens
The results of the work done in eSSIF-Lab should contribute to provide individuals with means that help them to electronically negotiate and conduct %%transactions|transaction%% in the widest sense of the word. Such means make it easier for them to participate in transactions, both in the Internet and in physical life.

Criteria to determine that the objective is fulfilled include:
  - logins (username, password) are eliminated.
  - people can fill in forms (e.g. for applying for products or services) fast, and easily.
  - people are protected from transacting with malicious %%parties|party%%.
  - people find the provided means helpful as they seek to exercize their rights under privacy acts such as the [GDPR](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-eu_en).

### Empower European and other organizations and governments
The results of the work done in eSSIF-Lab should contribute to provide %%organizations|organization%% (e.g. enterprises, governments) with means that help them to electronically negotiate and conduct %%transactions|transaction%% in the widest sense of the word. Such means make it easier for them to participate in transactions, both in the Internet and in physical life.

Criteria to determine that the objective is fulfilled include:
   - the costs of %%validating|validation%% the data that organizations need to determine whether or not to commit to a transaction, is significantly reduced.
   - the lead time of (administrative) processes, such as applying for a product or service, is significantly reduced.
   - the efforts of satisfying the requirements regarding their duties under privacy acts such as the [GDPR](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-eu_en), and showing compliance, is significantly reduced.
   - *new business ecosystem paradigms* materialize, with thousands of new jobs, many new job categories and new business opportunities for existing and new European companies.
### Design and Develop an SSI Infrastructure
The %%SSI-Infrastructure|ssi-infrastructure%%* is the 'hard' (IT) Infrastructure that we need to generically support %%parties|party%% (enterprises, governments, individuals, ...). The result of the work done in eSSIF-Lab should contribute to the creation (and maintenance) of components that are fitting in an %%SSI Infrastructure|ssi-infrastructure%%.

Criteria to determine that the objective is fulfilled include:
- 'horizontal interoperability', i.e. the components that are part of the %%SSI Infrastructure|ssi-infrastructure%% work (interoperate) with other components of that infrastructure;
- 'vertical interoperability', i.e. the components that are part of the %%SSI Infrastructure|ssi-infrastructure%% can be used very easily by application software and other non-infrastructural (technical) components,
- 'documentation interoperability', i.e. ensuring/facilitating that documentation of the infrastructural (and perhaps other) components can use a single, well-defined %%terminology|terminology%% that is based on validated %%mental models|mental-model%%.

### Design and Develop SSI Assurance Communities
%%SSI Assurance Communities|ssi-assurance-community%% (ACs) is the 'soft' Infrastructure that complements the (hard) %%SSI Infrastructure|ssi-infrastructure%%. The result of the work done in eSSIF-Lab should contribute to the creation (and maintenance) of %%communities|community%% that provide governance, management and optionally technical components and or services that facilitate the adoption of SSI and transformation of its members internal organization, processes and IT, such that it can start, or continue to use the %%SSI infrastructure|ssi-infrastructure%% and reap its projected benefits.

Criteria to determine that the objective is fulfilled include:
- the number of %%SSI Assurance Communities|ssi-assurance-community%% is non-zero, and growing;
- processes, procedures and other mechanisms for the governance of SSI-related technology, data and administrative processes have become available and are being used;'
- (IT) tooling that supports %%SSI-ACs|ssi-assurance-community%% become available, such as %%credential catalogues|credential-catalogue%%, accreditation schemes that apply to the issuing of certain kinds of credentials, etc.
