# Terms for eSSIF-Lab;

This is a repo within which eSSIF-Lab terminology is experimentally subjected to the terminology mechanisms that are (to be) provided by TOIP (or its CTWG), e.g. to build, version, and release glossaries, to reference from whitepapers, and so forth.

Terms defined in this repo can be found using the tag `#essiflab`.

Currently, there only a (handmade) [glossary](docs/glossary.html) is available.
