# Terms for eSSIF-Lab;

This is a repo within which eSSIF-Lab terminology is experimentally subjected to the terminology mechanisms that are (to be) provided by TOIP (or its CTWG), e.g. to build, version, and release glossaries, to reference from whitepapers, and so forth.

### Next Steps (after creating the repo)

- [ ] Add at least one term to your wiki. (`Wiki` &gt; `New Page` &mdash; copy the template from [here](https://github.com/trustoverip/concepts-and-terminology-wg/wiki/Term-Template) and fill it out.)
- [ ] Choose an official tag that will identify &lt;your scope&gt; across all glossaries and terminology work that uses this tooling. Follow [these conventions](https://github.com/trustoverip/concepts-and-terminology-wg/blob/master/docs/hash-tags.md#predefined).
- [ ] Create a page on your wiki called "Tags". The content of this page should be a single simple line of hash tags. Every page in your wiki will automatically be tagged with anything you put on this line. You can put more than one tag here, but you should at least include the official tag that you chose in the previous step.
- [ ] Share the URL for this repo with people who need to collaborate with you.
- [ ] Delete these instructions, now that they're irrelevant.
